# AC-Rinse
A laundry status application designed for students in college. It will show information on the available washing and drying machines in campus and updates the time remaining for the completion of a load in real time. It uses real data which the program retrieves and updates based on what users do. Designed by me and 2 colleagues at Amherst College.
